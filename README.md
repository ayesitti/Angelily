# React + Vite

Welcome to the HOOKS Vacation Planner App! 
This is a React-based web application that allows users to explore and plan their dream vacations. 
Users can view a list of hotels, leave comments about their experiences, add hotels to their favorites, and make personal notes for their future trips.


1. **Explore Hotels:** Browse the list of available hotels. Click on each hotel to view more details.

2. **Leave Comments:** Share your experiences by leaving comments and reviews about the hotels you've visited.

3. **Favorites:** Add hotels to your favorites list for easy access later.

4. **Notes:** Make personal notes for your future vacations. Edit and save them as needed.
   
Contributions are always welcome! If you have any suggestions, bug reports, or improvements, please feel free to submit a pull request.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
